# hello-world
I think this is my first repository!

I joined GitHub to comment on <a link="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad ++</a>, then later made some minor edits to <a link="https://github.com/OfficeDev/VBA-content">VBA-Content</a>. Now, I'm trying to create some production-worthy VBA code for utilities I've used over the years.

I know people say VBA isn't a real language, but many, many people have done some really, really awesome things with VBA, in spite of its shortcomings. The first guru that had an impact on my coding was John Walkenbach, way back in the Compuserve days. There are many, many others, too many to name, but there really is a lot you can do with VBA. Two standouts that have really awesome repositories of VBA code are Rob Van Der Woude
